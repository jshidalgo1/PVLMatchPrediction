Format
The 2025 Reinforced Conference retains the format used in the 2024 edition:[36]

First round
The preliminary round is split into two rounds.
In the first round, the twelve teams were divided into two pools of six teams each.
The first round is a single round-robin tournament, with each team playing one match against all other teams in their pool for a total of five matches. Teams will be ranked using the FIVB Ranking System.
Second round
In the second round, teams will be assigned to new pools based on results from the first round. The top three teams from one pool will be grouped with the bottom three teams from the other pool.
Results from the first round will be carried over, and teams will only play against opponents who they haven't faced in the first round for an additional three matches. By the end of the second round, all teams will have played a total of eight matches. Teams will continue to be ranked using the FIVB Ranking System.
The top eight teams based on combined records across the two rounds will advance to the quarterfinals.
Teams ranked 9th to 12th will be eliminated and be ranked accordingly in the final standings.

Pool standing procedure
First, teams are ranked by the number of matches won.
If the number of matches won is tied, the tied teams are then ranked by match points, wherein:
Match won 3–0 or 3–1: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser.
Match won 3–2: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser.
In case of any further ties, the following criteria shall be used:
Set ratio: the number of sets won divided by number of sets lost.
Point ratio: number of points scored divided by number of points allowed.
Head-to-head standings: any remaining tied teams are ranked based on the results of head-to-head matches involving the teams in question.
